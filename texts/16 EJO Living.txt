EJO Living
Designing elegance for premium living.
The Story EJO Living is a boutique interior design and real estate studio based in Switzerland, known for its "Inspiring Interiors" and meticulous attention to detail. Working within Vitamin Studio, my task was to redesign their digital presence to match the high-end, sophisticated nature of their physical projects. The goal was to create a website that feels as curated and balanced as the spaces they design for their exclusive clientele.
The Approach The design direction for EJO Living was rooted in "minimalist luxury." I focused on an editorial-style layout, using expansive white space to let the high-quality architectural photography breathe. My work involved designing key sections such as the "Our Studio" and "Projects" pages, where I implemented a clean, grid-based system that allows for an effortless showcase of their portfolio—from Swiss lakeside villas to modern kitchen designs. The typography was carefully selected to be both timeless and modern, ensuring that the brand’s message of "quality over quantity" is felt in every scroll.
The Result The result is a digital environment that reflects the serenity and sophistication of a high-end interior design studio. The UI/UX was tailored to a high-net-worth audience, focusing on clarity, ease of navigation, and a visual language that communicates prestige without being loud. This project stands as a strong example of my ability to design for the luxury sector, where subtlety and precision are the ultimate markers of quality.
