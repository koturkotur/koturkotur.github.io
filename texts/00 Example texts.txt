Brand identity and website redesign for a New York logistics company specializing in freight, moves, and furniture installations. The project encompassed a complete visual overhaul, from logo design to a fully responsive website.

We developed a clean, bold brand identity centered around a custom wordmark and a vibrant blue color palette. The website was built with a focus on user experience, featuring clear service descriptions, an intuitive quote request flow, and responsive design that works seamlessly across all devices.
