GAJ Inženjering
Foundations of digital execution.
The Story GAJ Inženjering represents a significant milestone in my career as one of my first professional web projects. Working within Korak Studio, I was tasked with taking a pre-defined brand identity and translating it into a functional, professional website. This project was a deep dive into the practical side of web design, focusing on how to present a large portfolio of engineering projects to a corporate audience.
The Approach While the core branding was already established, my role was to handle the visual solutions for the site's layout and the complete implementation using the Semplice platform. I focused on creating a clean, structured environment that mirrors the precision of the engineering industry. The challenge was to organize a vast "Reference List" of construction projects into a navigable and visually consistent archive. This project taught me the importance of grid systems, responsive design, and how to maintain brand integrity across a complex site architecture.
The Result The final website serves as a robust digital catalog for GAJ Inženjering, showcasing decades of engineering expertise. For me, this project remains a key piece of my portfolio as it marks the beginning of my journey in professional web design, demonstrating my early ability to handle technical implementation and corporate aesthetics.
