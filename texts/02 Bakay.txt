Bakay Studio
The intersection of digital distortion and modern craftsmanship.
The Story Bakay Studio is a fashion house where the past and future collide, creating designs that inhabit the "grey area" between our online and offline lives. Their collections are defined by a mix of hyper-feminine, futuristic aesthetics and retro-inspired silhouettes. To translate this subversive vision into a digital flagship, Bakay needed an e-commerce experience that felt as avant-garde as the garments themselves. Building on the core visual direction, the challenge was to build a site that acts as a portal into this distorted, digital world.
The Approach My role was to bridge the gap between high-fidelity design and a living, breathing web experience. Working in Webflow, I focused on creating a layout that supports the brand's bold visual language—combining sharp, liquid-like textures with clean, structural lines. I implemented specific interactive behaviors and custom animations that reflect the brand's "digital era" philosophy. From fluid, rhythmic transitions to experimental navigation, every element was engineered to enhance the user's journey through Bakay’s futuristic vision.
The Result A high-performance digital flagship that serves as both a retail platform and an immersive brand statement. The final site captures the essence of Bakay Studio: bold, tech-forward, and meticulously crafted for the contemporary society.
