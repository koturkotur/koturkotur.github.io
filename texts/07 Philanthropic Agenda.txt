Philanthropic Agenda
A structural approach to social change.
The Story Commissioned by the Trag Foundation, the Philanthropic Agenda is a comprehensive publication designed to outline strategic goals for social development. Working within Korak Studio, I was tasked with designing a book that reflects the importance and urgency of the philanthropic mission. The challenge was to transform a vast amount of research and data into an engaging, readable, and aesthetically sophisticated publication that speaks to both stakeholders and the general public.
The Approach The design process involved a seamless integration of Adobe’s professional tools. I used Adobe Illustrator to craft custom charts, diagrams, and various graphic elements, ensuring that complex data was presented with mathematical precision and visual clarity. These elements were then integrated into Adobe InDesign, where I established a strict typographic grid and a clear information hierarchy. Under the mentorship of Kosta Rakićević, I refined the editorial details to balance bold, impactful headlines with clean, legible body text. The layout emphasizes white space and a minimalist aesthetic to make the social agenda feel both modern and accessible.
The Result The final design was selected by the client for its professional execution and modern editorial voice. By combining custom vector graphics with high-end layout design, the publication successfully turns a strategic document into a premium piece of print design that communicates social impact with clarity.
