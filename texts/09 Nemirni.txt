Nemirni (Restless)
Visualizing the narrative before the first frame.
The Story Before evolving into the acclaimed TV series "Nemirni," the project began as a high-stakes pitch based on the crime novel by Marko Popović. I designed the comprehensive synopsis/pitch deck for Firefly Productions. This document was the primary visual and narrative tool used to present the series for funding and production. The goal was to translate the gritty, noir-inspired atmosphere of the book into a professional editorial format that would capture the attention of industry decision-makers.
The Approach The design adopts a moody, dramatic aesthetic that mirrors the suspenseful nature of a crime thriller. I focused on a high-contrast visual language, using bold typography and cinematic page compositions to guide the reader through character arcs, plot twists, and episode breakdowns. Since the document needed to function both as a premium printed publication for boardroom presentations and as a high-end digital PDF, I maintained a strict grid system that balanced dense storytelling with atmospheric imagery.
The Result The pitch deck played a vital role in the pre-production phase, successfully helping "Nemirni" move from a conceptual stage to a full-scale TV production. The project stands as a prime example of how editorial design can set the visual tone for a major television series long before the cameras start rolling.
