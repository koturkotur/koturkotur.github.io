Disrupting Drinks Report
Complexity simplified through structured design.
The Story "Disrupting Drinks" is a comprehensive industry report by Prohibition Partners that explores the intersection of the traditional beverage industry and the emerging cannabis sector. As a flagship publication used by global investors and stakeholders, the report required a high level of precision and clarity. My role was to design the complete layout of this extensive report, ensuring that deep industry insights were presented in a visually engaging and accessible format.
The Approach Working with an established brand identity, I focused on the meticulous organization of information. The challenge was to balance dense textual data with complex charts, tables, and infographics. I maintained a strict editorial grid to ensure consistency across all sections, from executive summaries to detailed market analyses. Special attention was given to typography and hierarchy, allowing readers to navigate through the data-heavy content effortlessly. The design needed to feel premium and authoritative, matching the high-value intelligence the report provides.
The Result The final report stands as a professional, data-driven publication that is currently used as a key resource in the industry. For my portfolio, this project demonstrates my expertise in editorial design and my ability to manage large-scale documents where detail, structure, and clarity are paramount.
