Žitnica
Digitalizing the grain marketplace.
The Story Žitnica is a comprehensive B2B/B2C web application designed to revolutionize the agricultural trade. The project involved creating a digital ecosystem where producers and buyers can trade grains with maximum transparency and efficiency. This was a "from scratch" challenge: I was responsible for the entire brand identity, the complex UX logic of a trading platform, and a high-fidelity UI that makes data-heavy grain trading intuitive and accessible.
The Approach As the lead product designer, I focused on building a scalable design system that handles complex user flows. The application features a robust marketplace with advanced filtering (crop type, location, price), interactive mapping for localized search, and a secure internal messaging system for direct negotiations. I designed a dual-interface system—one for sellers to manage their listings and analytics, and another for buyers to browse and secure deals. The visual identity, from the logo to the interface, uses a palette of "earth and growth" tones, balanced with a clean, grid-based layout to ensure professional-grade usability.
The Result A fully functional, end-to-end digital marketplace that transforms traditional grain trading into a streamlined, modern experience. Žitnica stands as a benchmark for AgTech solutions, combining sophisticated branding with a powerful, developer-aligned product architecture.
