Cannabis Oceania: Visualizing the Future
Turning market data into compelling visual narratives.
The Story In support of the launch of the Oceania Cannabis Report by Prohibition Partners, I was tasked with creating a suite of high-impact visual assets. The goal was to take the complex data points from the report and present them through a series of professional posters and social media graphics. This project was about more than just numbers; it was about creating a visual identity for a rapidly growing industry, targeted at politicians, business leaders, and healthcare experts at major conferences in Melbourne.
The Approach My focus was on "Accelerating Growth" through visual clarity. I designed a series of posters that utilized bold, clean typography contrasted with atmospheric, organic imagery—bringing a human and natural element to the business data. The work involved extensive data visualization, including detailed maps of Australian license holders and complex charts regarding public attitudes toward legalization. I translated these themes into social media assets, ensuring that key statistics—like the projected $1.55B market value—were presented in a punchy, shareable format that maintained the brand’s authoritative tone.
The Result The result was a cohesive set of marketing assets that successfully bridged the gap between deep-dive industry intelligence and high-level visual communication. From large-scale conference posters to snackable data visualization for digital platforms, the project demonstrated my ability to handle sensitive and complex information with a sophisticated, modern design aesthetic.
