Moje Stado
Connecting local farms with the digital marketplace.
The Story Moje Stado is an innovative advertising platform designed to bridge the gap between traditional Serbian farms and modern consumers. Similar to large-scale grain exchanges, this marketplace was built from the ground up to facilitate the sale of livestock and authentic, farm-to-table products. The challenge was to take a rustic, traditional industry and translate it into a clean, high-trust digital environment that empowers local producers.
The Approach My goal was to create an intuitive "digital village square" where transparency and quality are at the forefront. I designed a structured marketplace that allows users to easily navigate between different livestock categories—such as cattle, sheep, and poultry—as well as finished artisanal goods like aged meats and cheeses. By implementing a clear hierarchy for farm profiles and product listings, I ensured that the platform feels professional yet accessible. The user interface focuses on clarity, using a minimalist grid to showcase everything from "live weight" livestock to premium local delicacies.
The Result A robust, user-centric marketplace that simplifies the advertising process for farmers while providing a seamless shopping experience for consumers. Moje Stado stands as a modern digital flagship for the agricultural community, proving that even the most traditional sectors can thrive through thoughtful design.
