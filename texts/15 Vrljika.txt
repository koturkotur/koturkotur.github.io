Vrljika
Anti-design as a bond of brotherhood.
The Story Vrljika is more than just a creative outlet; it is a lifelong collaboration rooted in deep friendship. Working with my closest friends, this project serves as a collective therapeutic journey where we push each other to the limits of expression. As an "anti-band" that deconstructs the boundaries of metal and hardcore, Vrljika requires a visual architect who understands their soul. This is a space of absolute trust, where professional constraints vanish, making room for a raw, uncompromising aesthetic that we build together, day by day.
The Approach The visual language of Vrljika is a deliberate act of rebellion—an "anti-design" manifesto that mirrors the band's chaotic, multi-genre sound. Since there is no "client-agency" barrier, I am free to experiment with the most radical ideas. For their gig posters, I reject traditional symmetry in favor of distorted typography, gritty textures, and high-contrast imagery that captures the visceral energy of our shared experiences. Whether it’s album covers, merchandise, or experimental videos, the process is organic and raw, fueled by the DIY spirit of the underground scene and the unbreakable bond of brotherhood.
The Result The result is an evolving, living archive of our growth as artists and friends. Vrljika stands as the most personal segment of my portfolio—a testament to what happens when design is stripped of commercial pretense and used as a tool for pure, authentic connection. It showcases my ability to direct a complex, evolving brand identity that lives on the fringes of culture, driven by passion rather than a brief.
