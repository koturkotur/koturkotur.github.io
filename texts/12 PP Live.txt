Prohibition Partners LIVE
Dynamic visuals for global industry leaders.
The Story Prohibition Partners LIVE is a premium global conference platform dedicated to the legal cannabis industry. I was responsible for creating the visual energy of their online events and live streams. The project required a modern, high-tech aesthetic that reflects the innovative nature of the industry while maintaining a professional B2B tone for international investors and experts.
The Approach The centerpiece of my work was the motion design for the conference opening sequence. This intro was used across all digital touchpoints, from the main online event to various live-streamed interviews and panels. The motion graphics were designed to be sleek and engaging, setting a high-production-value tone for the sessions. In addition to the video work, I developed a comprehensive set of social media assets. These were used to promote guest speakers and key topics, ensuring a consistent visual identity across LinkedIn, Instagram, and the conference's digital platforms.
The Result The motion and social media assets provided PP Live with a cohesive and energetic digital presence. By blending motion graphics with structured social media design, the project successfully elevated the brand’s online engagement, making it stand out as a premier destination for industry insights and global networking.
