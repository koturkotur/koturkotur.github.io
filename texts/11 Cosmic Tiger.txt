Cosmic Tiger
Amplifying the voice of the streets.
The Story Cosmic Tiger is more than a music project; it’s an experimental initiative born out of a desire to support raw, undiscovered talent. Working at Vitamin Studio under the mentorship of Ivan Zupanc, we identified a unique street artist with immense potential. The project was driven by a non-commercial, purely artistic mission: to provide a high-end visual platform for a musician who embodies the soul of the streets but lacks the resources to reach a wider audience.
The Approach The visual direction was deeply inspired by the artist's sound—a gritty blend of raw street poetry and atmospheric, psychedelic beats. My role was to translate this "cosmic-noir" energy into a cohesive visual language. I worked on creating a cinematic experience that mirrors the hypnotic flow of his music. This included assisting in video production that favors shadows and raw textures over polished aesthetics, as well as designing high-impact posters and Instagram content. The goal was to build a brand that feels as authentic and uncompromising as the lyrics, using bold typography and a moody color palette to capture the artist’s unique sonic identity.
The Result The result is a compelling audiovisual identity that introduces Cosmic Tiger to the world. For me, this project remains a favorite because of its human element—it proves that design and creative direction can be powerful vehicles for social and artistic empowerment. It adds a cinematic, experimental layer to my portfolio, showcasing a versatile approach to building an artist's brand from the ground up, where the visual finally meets the profound depth of the sound.
