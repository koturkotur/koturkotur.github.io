Stadion Shopping Center
High-frequency design for a premier retail destination.
The Story Stadion Shopping Center is one of Belgrade’s largest retail hubs, acting as a vibrant home to hundreds of international and local brands. Working on this account at Vitamin Studio, my challenge was to create a visual bridge between the shopping center’s identity and the diverse array of stores it hosts. The marketing strategy required a constant flow of content that promotes the destination itself while simultaneously giving a spotlight to the latest collections and offers from its many tenants—ranging from global fashion giants to local boutiques.
The Approach In collaboration with a copywriter and strategist, I led the visual execution for Stadion’s digital presence. My role was to design high-impact Instagram and Facebook content that could seamlessly integrate different brand aesthetics into one cohesive "Stadion vibe." This involved creating seasonal campaign visuals, promoting in-center events, and designing social media templates for various store announcements. The goal was to maintain a trend-driven and energetic aesthetic that appeals to a wide demographic, encouraging foot traffic and keeping the center top-of-mind for shoppers.
The Result The result was a dynamic and versatile digital presence that successfully managed the visual demands of a major retail hub. Handling the creative output for such an active client sharpened my ability to produce high-quality, commercial assets under tight deadlines, ensuring that the visual narrative of the shopping center remained consistent even with hundreds of different brands in the mix.
