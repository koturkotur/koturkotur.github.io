My Perfect Vacation
Mapping out the complete booking experience.
The Story Created as a comprehensive design pitch, My Perfect Vacation was a personal milestone in tackling large-scale UI. The challenge wasn't necessarily about reinventing the wheel, but rather about handling the sheer volume of information required for a travel platform. I had to figure out how to neatly organize destinations, dates, complex filters, and accommodation details into a single, cohesive user flow that didn't feel overwhelming.
The Approach I focused on keeping the interface as straightforward and intuitive as possible. Working through numerous screens and user states, the goal was to balance dense booking data with a light, breezy visual style. I relied on a spacious grid, clear and accessible typography, and inviting imagery to do the heavy lifting. Every element was designed to be functional first, ensuring that users could easily navigate the booking process from search to checkout.
The Result Though it remained a conceptual project, the extensive effort and problem-solving involved made it a crucial stepping stone in my UI/UX journey. It stands as a clean, highly functional prototype of a modern travel platform that puts usability front and center.
